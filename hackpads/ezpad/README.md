# ezpad

* Note: the full CAD file was greater than 25 MB and thus I had to zip it for github to allow it onto the servers. otherwise all other files should follow the correct structure

A macropad (mini-keyboard) with 9 mechanical keys, 0.91" OLED screen, and rotary encoder. Custom-built and wired PCB. Powered by a Seeed XIAO RP2040.

After many failed attempts at using the correct footprints, I finally my very first PCB! I then put it in a case that I created on Onshape.

This is my submission for Hackpad V3 and my second submission for Highway! It's also hopefully a precursor project to a larger custom mechanical keyboard I'll be making soon!
